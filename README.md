# The Effectiveness of Exercise in Parkinson's Disease

This study investigates how well exercise can control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and halt the disease's progression. Regular exercise can enhance balance, gait, motor function, and quality of life. Exercises that strengthen cardiovascular health also increase range of motion, improve muscle strength, improve balance and coordination, and improve cardiovascular health. The creation of a mobile app for tailored workout plans is also covered in the study.
